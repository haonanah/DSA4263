## About The Project
<a name="readme-top"></a>

Insurance fraud, especially in vehicle claims, is a growing global issue that costs the industry billions annually and leads to higher premiums for honest customers. With the increasing complexity and subtlety of fraudulent activities—such as staged accidents and inflated repair costs—traditional methods of detection are no longer sufficient.

This project aims to tackle insurance fraud using a data-driven approach, applying machine learning techniques to identify suspicious claims more effectively. By leveraging real-world data, we seek to build a fraud detection system that is both accurate and practical for deployment in the insurance industry. Our goal is to reduce financial losses, ease the burden on investigative resources, and help create fairer outcomes for all stakeholders.

This project is part of our graded coursework in the National University of Singapore module DSA4263 Sense-Making Case Analysis: Business and Commerce.
